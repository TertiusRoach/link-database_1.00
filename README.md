# Link Databse 1.00

I struggled to establish a connection to MongoDB through the terminal on my MacBook Air running the Big Sur Operating System. Despite investing two days in the endeavor, I made no progress. Eventually, I opted for the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/) as an alternative. I'm uncertain whether MongoDB is the right tool for achieving my goals, but I'm hopeful that this approach will yield better results.

For now I'm ignoring back-end.js as it contains information that might breach security in regards to MongoDB. Please don't hack me.
